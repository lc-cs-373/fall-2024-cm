QUESTION 1:
    SET  -> 3
    REF  -> 4
    NAME -> 4
    NEED -> 4

QUESTION 2:
    SET  -> 2
    REF  -> 2
    NAME -> 0
    NEED -> 2

QUESTION 5:
[int => int]
(I think it basically just makes a function that outputs t^3)

QUESTION 6:
    - add1(0) does not return a bool, so the if statement fails.
    - The return at the end of function p returns the function 
    rather than an integer, but it's supposed to return an integer.
